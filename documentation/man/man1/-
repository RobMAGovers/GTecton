       _p_l_n performs finite element (FE) calculations to solve  the  mechanical
       equilibrium  as  well as the heat equation. Temperature-dependent mate-
       rial properties and non-linear rheologies are implemented.  _p_l_n is  the
       2D version of the massively parallel GGTTEECCTTOONN FE package.

       When  called  without  arguments, _p_l_n assumes that an input file, named
       TECIN.DAT, exists in the current working directory. In this file, nodal
       point  coordinates, mechanical boundary conditions, material properties
       and elements are defined. This file also contains  switching  variables
       which  control,  for  instance, the solution mode. If thermal solutions
       are requested, a second file (TEMPIN.DAT) is assumed, which defines the
       thermal  problem.  Refer to textbooks on the finite element method, the
       GTECTON equations manual (see LITERATURE) for  the  underlying  princi-
       ples.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       aass[[cciiii]]
              Writes   ASCII  data to _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_F_E_D_S_K_._D_A_T_.  Same as nnoobbii[[nnaarryy]].
              The default is binary.

       bbii[[nnaarryy]]
              Write binary FE-output  data  to  _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_F_E_D_S_K_._D_A_T_.   Same  as
              nnooaass[[cciiii]].  This is the default

       eecchhoo==00 Silent  mode,  i.e.  set  echoing off (this is the default). See
              also 'noecho

       eecchhoo,, eecchhoo==11
              Normal echoing mode. Major stages of the program are reported.

       eecchhoo==22 Print info on mechanical input file  structure.  Typically  used
              when "debugging" the mechanical input file.

       eecchhoo==2222
              Print  very  detailed  info  on mechanical input file structure.
              Typically used when "debugging" the mechanical input  file.   It
              is  well  advised to direct output to file, when using this echo
              value.

       eecchhoo==33 Print what is written to "FEDSK.DAT" (only in "ASCII"-mode, oth-
              erwise equivalent to "echo=1")

       eecchhoo==44 Print  info on thermal input file structure. Typically used when
              "debugging" the thermal input file.

       eecchhoo==55 Print info on the interaction between GTecton and PETSc.   Warn-
              ing: This can yield a lot of output

       eecchhoo==66 Print info on the time spent in various part of the code. Useful
              for profiling.

       eecchhoo==88 Print info on the health of the various threads. Due to the need
              to  synchronise the threads in order to produce readable output,
              this echo value will slow the code down considerably.

       eecchhoo==99 Print info for general debugging. Here be dragons.

       ffeeddsskk==[[ddiirrnnaammee//]][[bbaasseennaammee]]
              Writes FE-output according to how _d_i_r_n_a_m_e and _b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e are  sup-
              plied.

              When  only  _b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e  is  given, the output will be written into
              _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e_._t_i_m_e_s_t_e_p_._p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r_I_D.

              When only _d_i_r_n_a_m_e_/ is given -- the '/' is required in this  case
              --     the     output     will    be    written    into    _w_o_r_k_-
              _p_a_t_h_/_d_i_r_n_a_m_e_/_F_E_D_S_K_._D_A_T_._t_i_m_e_s_t_e_p_._p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r_I_D.  (FEDSK  being  the
              default output name.)

              When  both  are  given,  the  output  will be written into _w_o_r_k_-
              _p_a_t_h_/_d_i_r_n_a_m_e_/_b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e_._t_i_m_e_s_t_e_p_._p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r_I_D.

              When this option is not used (ffeeddsskk should not be  used  without
              an   argument)   the   output   will   be   written  into  _w_o_r_k_-
              _p_a_t_h_/_F_E_D_S_K_._D_A_T_._t_i_m_e_s_t_e_p_._p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r_I_D.

              After a run, the output of the various processors  can  be  com-
              bined  with  _m_e_r_g_e_f_i_l_e_s,  to  obtain  a  single  file  for  each
              timestep. See `man mergefiles'.

       ffeeiinn==ffiillee
              Reads   input    from    _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_f_i_l_e    instead    of    _w_o_r_k_-
              _p_a_t_h_/_T_E_C_I_N_._D_A_T_,which_i_sthe_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_.

       ffeeoouutt[[==ffiillee]]
              Writes  extensive information on input and output of the FE cal-
              culations  to  _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_F_E_O_U_T_._D_A_T(default).   Optional  =   _f_i_l_e
              replaces  output  file name _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_F_E_O_U_T_._D_A_T by _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_f_i_l_e_.
              Note that this option does not work for runs on multiple proces-
              sors.  For detailed information on the input on multiple-proces-
              sors runs, consider using echo=22 instead.

       nnooaass[[cciiii]]
              Write binary FE-output  data  to  _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_F_E_D_S_K_._D_A_T_.   Same  as
              bbii[[nnaarryy]].  This is the default

       nnoobbii[[nnaarryy]]
              Writes  ASCII  data  to  _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_F_E_D_S_K_._D_A_T_.  Same aass[[cciiii]].  The
              default is to write data as binary

       nnooeecchhoo Silent mode, i.e. set echoing off (this is the default). Same as
              eecchhoo==00.

       nnooffeeoouutt
              Does not write _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_F_E_O_U_T_._D_A_T_.  This is the default.

       nnoossoo   During  a  _p_l_n  run, all processors generate a temporary file in
              _F_E_M_/ containing the TECIN.DAT file with all the  included  files
              explicitly  included.   These file file can easily become larger
              than the available space on _F_E_M_/. To prevent this,  include  the
              files  explicitly  before  running  pln, using ssooeelliimm (see: `man
              soelim'). During the run, provide the result of ssooeelliimm as  argu-
              ment  to  the  ffeeiinn  option  and add the nnoossoo option.  This will
              cause all the processes to read the complete file directly.

       oouutt==ffiillee
              Merge standard output and standard error into _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_f_i_l_e_.

       tteemmppiinn==ffiillee
              Reads thermal  FE-input  from  _w_o_r_k_p_a_t_h_/_f_i_l_e  instead  of  _w_o_r_k_-
              _p_a_t_h_/_T_E_M_P_I_N_._D_A_T (the default file name).

       tteesstt   Perform  initialization  and  one single time step (if required)
              before stopping.

       wwoorrkkppaatthh==ddiirreeccttoorryy
              Directory that contains the model files.  This  is  particularly
              useful  when  submitting  a pln run to a cluster because compute
              nodes of the cluster do not necessarily  know  where  the  model
              input  files  are located. Defaults to current working directory
              if not given.

              scaling). More information can be found on the _P_E_T_S_c website.

       --kksspp__ttyyppee TTYYPPEE
              When using the _P_E_T_S_c iterative solvers, this flag can be used to
              set the Krylov subspace method (KSP). Not all types work for the
              GTECTON matrix problem! TYPE should be one of "richardson" (pre-

              and  tends to get very big for many applications. It is not used
              for post-processing and is intended to  be  used  for  elaborate
              checking of input data only.
