[1mNAME[0m
       picknps - select node numbers

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mpicknps  [22m-n  tecin.dat.nps  [-d 2|3] [-s selectionfile] [-m marker] [-x
       xvalue[:xmax]] [-y yvalue[:ymax]] [-z zvalue[:zmax]] [-e epsilon]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mpicknps [22mis a program for selecting node number on the basis of coloring
       (markers) or coodinate. This greatly simplifies application of boundary
       conditions, or further selection of element  sides  with  [4melmside[24m.   It
       works directly with the [4mGTECTON[24m nodal points files.

[1mVERSION[0m
       2018

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       [1m-n tecin.dat.nps[0m
              [4mpln[24m or [4mopn[24m format nodal point coordinate file.

       [1m-s selectionfile[0m
              [4mselectionfile[24m contains markers, x-coordinates, y-coordinates, or
              pairs of x and y-coordinates.  Grouping selection criteria  will
              be  more  efficient than calling [4mpicknps[24m consecutively with dif-
              ferent criteria.

       [1m-d dimension[0m
              Specify  the  spatial  dimension  of  the  problem  (2  or   3).
              Default=2.

       [1m-m marker[0m
              [4mtriangle[24m  marker,  for  instance  of some boundary. Note that an
              error margin is not required here. Also note  that  marker  zero
              typically  selects all the nodes on the inside of the domain, so
              be warned.

       [1m-x xvalue[0m
              Node x-coordinate.

       [1m-y yvalues[0m
              Node y-coordinate.

       [1m-z zvalues[0m
              Node z-coordinate (only in three dimensions).

       [1m-e epsilon[0m
              Search radius for coordinate selection. Use if coordinate is not
              found. To prevent numerical errors when searching around coordi-
              nates, it is advised to always use a small radius, as in [1m-e 1[0m
