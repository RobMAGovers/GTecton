[1mNAME[0m
       setprem  -  uses element center coordinates to assign radial elasticity
       variations to elements following the  classical  Preliminary  Reference
       Earth Model (PREM) of Dziewonsky and Anderson (1981).

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1msetprem  [22mis  a  support  program  for  finite element code [4mGTECTON[24m, and
       specifically [1mf3d[22m, to assist in defining elastic properties in elements.
       Node  and  element  file  names  are  assumed  to  be tecin.dat.nps and
       tecin.dat.elm. The third node coordinate is assumed  to  represent  the
       vertical distance with respect to the free surface. [1msetprep [22mwrites file
       tecin.dat.elasticity, with the first record refering to the first  ele-
       ment,  the  second to the second element and so on. The first column is
       the element material number, second column  Young's  modulus  (Pa)  and
       third column is Poisson's ratio.
