[1mNAME[0m
       axiplt - finite element post-processor.

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1maxiplt [22m[options]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4maxiplt[24m  is  an  interactive  program  for examining finite element (FE)
       input and output data. [4maxiplt[24m can also be viewed upon as  an  interface
       between FE program [4maxi[24m and plot programs [4mGMT[24m and [4mP[24m.

       When  called  without a file argument, [4maxiplt[24m reads commands from stan-
       dard input (stdin). On-line help is provided in this  interactive  mode
       by typing "?", or for example "? femi".  When a file argument is given,
       commands are read from this file until, after the end-of-file (EOF) has
       been reached succesfully, commands are read from stdin.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1mnoecho [22mSilent mode, i.e. set echoing off (this is the default).

       [1mecho   [22mEchoing mode. Major stages of the program are reported.

       [1mfile   [22mCommands file name.

[1mFILES[0m
       Files  which  are special to the program are described more extensively
       in the [4maxi[24m(L) manual pages.  More  specific,  FE  input  files  are  by
       default  assumed  to  be  "TECIN.DAT" and "TEMPIN.DAT". FE output is by
       default assumed to reside in "FEDSK.DAT".

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       Environmental variable PU should be set to the subdirectory "putil"  of
       the directory where [4mp[24m resides.

       If set, variable MYTMP is the directory where temporary files are kept.
       If not set, temporary storage occurs in /tmp.
