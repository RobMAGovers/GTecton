[1mNAME[0m
       f3d  -  thermo-mechanical finite element program for 3-D tectonic model
       calculations.

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mf3d [22m[options]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mf3d[24m performs finite element (FE) calculations to solve  the  mechanical
       equilibrium  as  well as the heat equation. Temperature-dependent mate-
       rial properties and non-linear rheologies are implemented.  [4mf3d[24m is  the
       3D version of the [1mGTECTON [22mFE package.

       When  called  without  arguments, [4mf3d[24m assumes that an input file, named
       TECIN.DAT, exists in the current working directory. In this file, nodal
       point  coordinates, mechanical boundary conditions, material properties
       and elements are defined. This file also contains  switching  variables
       which  control,  for  instance, the solution mode. If thermal solutions
       are requested, a second file (TEMPIN.DAT) is assumed, which defines the
       thermal  problem.   Refer to textbooks on the finite element method and
       the GTECTON manual (see LITERATURE) for the underlying principles.

       The typical workflow of an f3d run typically consists of the  following
       stages:

       [1m1  [22mCreating the FEM input files: (a) Creating the mesh (see: [4mgmsh[24m); (b)
       Setting initial conditions and the boundary  conditions  (see:  [4mpicknps[0m
       and  [4melmside[24m); (c) Partitioning the mesh (see: [4mpartition[24m) (d) Verifying
       the FEM input (see: [4mplt3d[24m and [4mparaview[24m).

       [1m2 [22mComputing the finite element solution (see: [4mmpirun[24m and [4mqsub[24m)

       [1m3 [22mMerging the FEM output files produced by all the threads (see: [4mmerge-[0m
       [4mfiles[24m).  This step is also needed for a single-processor run.

       [1m4  [22mPostprocessing  and  visualizing the FEM results(see: [4mplt3d[24m and [4mpar-[0m
       [4maview[24m).


[1mVERSION[0m
       2021.08

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1mpartinfo=file[0m
              Gives name of the file with partitioning information.  Note that
              this  file  is  always required, even for single-processor runs.
              The default file name is partition.info.

       [1mas[cii] or nobi[nary][0m
              Writes ASCII (human-readible) data to  [4mworkpath/FEDSK.DAT.[24m   The
              default is binary.

       [1mbi[nary] or noas[cii][0m
              Write  binary FE-output data to [4mworkpath/FEDSK.DAT.[24m  This is the
              default.

       [1mtest[=0|1|2][0m
              test[=0]: No testing (default)
              test=1: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AFTER YOU SET UP A NEW MODEL. Perform
              additional (time consuming) tests on input data and continue: 1)
              positively oriented elements, 2) nodes that have been defined as
              both slippery and faulted.
              test=2:  Perform  initialization  and  one  single time step (if
              required) before stopping.

       [1mecho=0 or noecho[0m
              Silent mode, i.e. set echoing off (this is the default).

       [1mecho, echo=1[0m
              Normal echoing mode. Major stages of the program are reported.

       [1mecho=2 [22mPrint info on mechanical input file  structure.  Typically  used
              when "debugging" the mechanical input file.

       [1mecho=3 [22mPrint what is written to "FEDSK.DAT" (only in "ASCII"-mode, oth-
              erwise equivalent to "echo=1")

       [1mecho=4 [22mPrint info on thermal input file structure. Typically used  when
              "debugging" the thermal input file.

       [1mecho=5 [22mPrint  info on the interaction between GTecton and PETSc.  Warn-
              ing: This can yield a lot of output

       [1mecho=6 [22mPrint info on the time spent in various part of the code. Useful
              for profiling.

       [1mecho=8 [22mPrint info on the health of the various threads. Due to the need
              to synchronise the threads in order to produce readable  output,
              this echo value will slow the code down considerably.

       [1mdebug  [22mPrints extensive debugging information

       [1mbi[nary], noas[cii][0m
              Write binary FE-output data to [4mFEDSK.DAT.[24m  This is the default

       [1mfein=file[0m
              Reads input from [4mfile[24m instead of [4mTECIN.DAT.[0m

       [1mas[cii], nobi[nary][0m
              Writes   ASCII  data to [4mFEDSK.DAT.[24m  The default is to write data
              as binary.

       [1mfeout[=file][0m
              Writes extensive information on input and output of the FE  cal-
              culations  to  [4mFEOUT.DAT.[24m   Optional = [4mfile[24m replaces output file
              name [4mFEOUT.DAT[24m by [4mfile.[0m

       [1mnofeout[0m
              Does not write [4mFEOUT.DAT.[0m

       [1mout=file[0m
              Merge standard output and standard error into [4mfile.[0m

       [1mfedsk=[dirname/][basename][0m
              Writes FE-output according to how [4mdirname[24m and [4mbasename[24m are  sup-
              plied.

              When  only  [4mbasename[24m  is  given,  the ouput will be written into
              [4mbasename.timestep[24m.

              When only [4mdirname/[24m is given -- the '/' is required in this  case
              --  the  output will be written into [4mdirname/FEDSK.DAT.timestep[24m.
              (FEDSK being the default output name.)

              When  both  are  given,  the  output  will   be   written   into
              [4mdirname/basename.timestep[24m.

              When  this  option is not used ([1mfedsk [22mshould not be used without
              an argument) the output will be written into [4mFEDSK.DAT.timestep[24m.

       [1mtempin=file[0m
              Reads thermal FE-input from  [4mfile[24m  instead  of  [4mTEMPIN.DAT[24m  (the
              default file name).

       [1m-pc_type TYPE[0m
              When  using the [4mPetSc[24m iterative solvers, this flag allows to set
              the preconditioner that is used. Note that not  all  KSP's  give
              stable results! TYPE should be one of "none", "jacobi" (Jacobi),
              "sor" (successive overrelaxation), "lu" (direct solver, based on
              LU  factorization,  DEFAULT  for  mechanical problem), "bjacobi"

       [1m-ksp_type TYPE[0m
              When using the [4mPetSc[24m iterative solvers, this flag can be used to
              set the Krylov subspace method (KSP). Not all types work for the
              GTECTON matrix problem! TYPE should be one of "richardson" (pre-
              conditioned Richardson), "chebychev" (preconditioned Chebychev),

              website.

       [1m-ksp_rtol NUMBER[0m
              Sets relative tolerance for iterative solver in [4mPetSc[24m (default =
              1e-7).

[1mFILES[0m
       The names of all files can be changed (see OPTIONS). Names below  refer
       to defaults.

   [1mInput files[0m
       Input  files  can  be built from other include-files. Include-files are
       indicated by .so [4mfile,[24m [1msoelim [22mcan be  used  to  examine  the  resulting
       file.  Input files all are in fixed format.

       [1mTECIN.DAT[0m
              FE  input  file. In this file the geometry of the finite element
              mesh and the mechanical properties and boundary  conditions  are
              defined.

       [1mTEMPIN.DAT[0m
              FE  input file. In this file the thermal properties and boundary
              conditions are defined.

   [1mOutput files[0m
       [1mFEOUT.DAT[0m
              FE output file. This file gives a verbose report of in- and out-
              put  of  the finite element program. The file is in ASCII format
              and tends to get very big for many applications. It is not  used
              for  post-processing  and  is  intended to be used for elaborate
              checking of input data only.

       [1mFEDSK.DAT[0m
              FE output file. Compact output  used  for  post-processing  (see
              [4mplt3d[24m).  If not explicitly set to ASCII (see OPTIONS), this file
              has binary format.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       Environment variable MYTMP defines the directory where temporary  files
       are kept. If not set, temporary storage occurs in /tmp.

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH  should  point to the PETSC home directory in case that
       sparse solvers are being used.
