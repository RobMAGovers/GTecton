[1mNAME[0m
       gtecton - thermo-mechanical finite element software package

[1mINTRODUCTION[0m
       [4mgtecton[24m performs finite element (FE) calculations to solve the mechani-
       cal equilibrium as well as  the  heat  equation.  Temperature-dependent
       material properties and non-linear rheologies are implemented.  Differ-
       ent versions of the  program  refer  to  different  dimensionality  and
       solvers

[1mGTECTON OVERVIEW[0m
       [1mpln    [22mis the 2D version of GTECTON. "pln" stands for "plane". It comes
              in two varieties: [4mpln-D[24m uses the direct  solver,  [4mpln[24m  uses  the
              iterative solvers.

       [1mopn    [22mis the 2,5D version of GTECTON. "opn" stands for "out of plane",
              meaning that the model geometry is 2D, but that the code  solves
              for 3D displacements etc.  It comes in two varieties: [4mopn-D[24m uses
              the direct solver, [4mopn[24m uses the iterative solvers.

       [1mf3d    [22mis the 3D version of GTECTON. "f3d" stands for  "finite  element
              3D".   It  comes in two varieties: [4mf3d-D[24m uses the direct solver,
              [4mf3d[24m uses the iterative solvers.
