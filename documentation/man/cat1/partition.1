[1mNAME[0m
       partition - create partitioning of a tesselation

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mpartition  [22m-d  2|3  -n  tecin.dat.nps -e tecin.dat.elm -p #part [-f|-z]
       [-v]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mpartition [22mis a program used in conjunction with the mesh generator [4mtri-[0m
       [4mangle[24m.   Its  purpose  is to generate a partitioning of the tesselation
       created with [4mtriangle[24m such that the underlying model can be  solved  on
       multiple cpus.

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       [1m-d 2|3 [22mDimensionality, select either 2 for 2D, or 3 for 3D.

       [1m-n tecin.dat.nps[0m
              The  nodal  point  file  generated  by  [4mtri2fe[24m  in 2d (See: `man
              tri2fe') or by [4mgmsh2tecton[24m in 3d (See: `man gmsh2tecton').

       [1m-e tecin.dat.elm[0m
              The element file generated by [4mtri2fe[24m in 2d (See:  `man  tri2fe')
              or by [4mgmsh2tecton[24m in 3d (See: `man gmsh2tecton').

       [1m-p #part[0m
              The number of sub-domains to be created.

       [1m-f|-z  [22mOptional  argument  (choose  one):  -f refers to "FORTRAN-style"
              numbering of the output starting at 1 (=default). -z has number-
              ing starting at zero.

       [1m-v     [22mOptional argument: verbose performance output

[1mOUTPUTS[0m
       [4mtecin.dat.partf.nps[0m
              The nodal point file with for each nodal point:

       processor  number,  global  number,  coordinates, number of neighbours,
       neighbours

       [4mtecin.dat.partf.elm[0m
              The element file with for each element:

       processor number, global number, material number, vertices

       [4mpartition.info[0m
              File with partitioning information needed by the finite  element
              program.
