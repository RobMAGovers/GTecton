[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mgmsh2tecton [22mis an interface program between  mesh  generator  [4mGmsh[24m  and
       finite  element  code [4mGTECTON[24m. It can be used to create input files for
       [1mGTECTON[22m, or to select nodes or elements based on their tags (labels).

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       [1m-I     [22mShow info on the main ingredients of the mesh file

       [1m-c     [22mExtract [4mGTECTON[24m formatted nodal point coordinates (default).

       [1m-e     [22mExtract [4mGTECTON[24m formatted element definitions.

       [1m-n ISPEC[0m
              Extract node numbers  with  (integer)  label/tag  ISPEC.  It  is
              important  to  realize  the  hierarchy of the tags. Point labels
              take priority over line labels over surface labels. This is  how
              you  can  assign  label  10  to  a surface, label 20 to its edge
              lines, and label 30 to its edge points.

       [1m-s ISPEC[0m
              Extract the numbers of elements that  have  an  integer  surface
              label/tag  ISPEC.  Output columns represent element#, face#, the
              unit outward normal vector to the element face and  the  surface
              area  of the interface. This option is useful for defining trac-
              tions on surfaces.

       [1m-f ISPEC[0m
              Extract element  numbers  with  (integer)  fault  surface  label
              ISPEC.  This  option  is  useful  for defining both slippery and
              faulted nodes.  Output columns represent element#, node# of  the
              element  interface,  and the unit vector from the element center
              to the node, line center, or triangle center (See also:  -m  and
              -t output modifiers).

       [1m-i meshfile[0m
              [4mGmsh[24m  mesh  file.  If not given, [4mgmsh2tecton[24m reads from standard
              input.  [4mGmsh[24m can handle msh file formats version 2. Version 4 is
              not  yet  supported  but  you can use Mesh.MshFileVersion=2.2 in
              your [4mGmsh[24m .geo file to get version 2 output.

       [1m-l     [22mWrites line segments from the mesh file to a VTK file.

       [1m-m     [22mThis option modifies the output when -f is used, by  adding  the
              first  coordinate  of  the  point,  line or triangle as the last
              three columns of the output.

       [1m-o filename[0m
              Writes output to output file.

       [1m-v     [22mVerbose output, i.e., report main stages of the program.

       [1m-t     [22mWhen option -f is used, this option adds the physical volume tag
              of  the element to the output.  This is particularly useful when
              each side of a fault has a different material number so that the
              material  number  can  be used to indentify on which side of the
              fault an element is located.  Output columns represent element#,
              node#,  and  volume tag of the element, and the unit vector from
              the element center to the node, line center, or triangle center.
