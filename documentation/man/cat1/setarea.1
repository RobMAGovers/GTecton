[1mNAME[0m
       setarea - set refinement criteria for elements

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1msetarea  [22mbasename  [-p  x  y] [-l x1 y1 x2 y2] [-m mat] [-f factor] [-r
       type] [-a percentage] [-minsize min] [-maxsize max] [-x power]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1msetarea [22mis a program used in conjunction with the mesh generator [4mtrian-[0m
       [4mgle[24m.   Its  purpose is to generate an additional file for [4mtriangle[24m such
       that a subsequent mesh generation with [4mtriangle[24m results in a  new  mesh
       with  (local)  refinements  compared  to  the  original  mesh.  Running
       setarea on a mesh created by [4mtriangle[24m defined by three files, typically
       named

       domain.x.poly, domain.x.node, domain.x.ele,

       with x an integer, by [4msetarea[24m:

       [1msetarea domain.x [options][0m

       creates an area file domain.x.area which contains for every element the
       maximum allowed area of its refinement child triangles.   This  refine-
       ment can be applied by calling [4mtriangle[24m as follows:

       [1mtriangle -pqra domain.1[22m.

       The  [1m-r  [22m(refine)  option  will  cause [4mtriangle[24m to read the .area file,
       refine the mesh, and write the results to three new files

       domain.x+1.poly, domain.x+1.node, domain.x+1.ele.

       Note that [1mtriangle [22mlimits strong gradients in  element  size.  Multiple
       [1mtriangle[22m+[1melmsize  [22miterations  are therefore needed to create a strongly
       localized fine mesh.

       [4msetarea[24m allows for tuning the characteristic of the refinement.

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       [1mbasename[0m
              [4mtriangle[24m base name, e.g., "domain.1".

       [1m-p x y [22mFor refinement towards a point [4m(x,[24m [4my)[24m (this is the default  with
              the  point  located in the middle of the domain).  The specified
              point does not need to be located in the domain.

       [1m-l x1 y1 x2 y2[0m
              For refinement towards a line section given  by  begin  and  end
              points [4m(x1,[24m [4my1)[24m and [4m(x2,[24m [4my2)[24m.

       [1m-m mat [22mFor refinement of elements with material marker [4mmat[24m. There is no
              smoothing zone between the area with the  material  in  question
              and surrounding regions.

       [1m-f factor[0m
              [4mfactor[24m < 1, the refinement ratio (default 0.05). The area of the
              new elements at the location with the densest refinement will be
              this factor times the original area of the elements there.

       [1m-d distance[0m
              Specify  tapering  distance from the line or point.  The area of
              elements within this range will be reduced  depending  on  their
              actual  distance from the line or point; by the factor specified
              by [1m-f [22mclose to the line or point,  and  less  so  further  away.
              Note that increasing the tapering distance may result in smaller
              elements in the target region (because triangle  limits  element
              size gradients). We recommend that you use a significant part of
              your domain size for the tapering distance.

       [1m-r type[0m
              Parameter to tune the character of refining:

                 0 (default) refine elements by an amount that depends on the distance from a point or line
                   (tapered refinement). The smallest elements (close to the point or line) will be reduced
                   in size by a factor that is specified via [1m-f factor[22m.

                 1 uniformly refine part of the domain given by the [4m-a[24m percentage (100% is entire domain).
                   If [4m-a[24m is not given, the region within distance [4m-d[24m from the point or line is refined.

              1002 refine towards point/line of refinement over entire domain

                                                            distance
                   refinement factor = ( f + (1-f) * ---------------------- ) ^ power
                                                      ratio * max distance

              1021 same as 1002, but takes the maximum area ([4m-a[24m) into account, so the refinement does not necessarily
                   cover the entire domain.

              1003 refine towards point/line of refinement over entire domain, according to

                                                distance
                   refinement factor = ( ---------------------- ) ^ power
                                          ratio * max distance

              1031 same as 1003, but takes the maximum area ([4m-a[24m) into account, so the refinement does not necessarily
                   cover the entire domain.

       [1m-a percentage[0m
              Denotes which part of the domain should be refined (100 = entire
              domain); used only by refinement types 1, 21 and 31.

       [1m-minsize min[0m
              Specify  minimum  area  for  elements  that  are  to be refined.
              Smaller elements will remain unmodified by the refinement.

       [1m-maxsize max[0m
              Specify maximum area for elements that are to be refined. Larger
              elements will remain unmodified by the refinement.

       [1m-minrefresult min[0m
              Specify  minimum  area  for  elements of refined grid. Note that
              this is an estimate only.  In case (original size *  factor)  is
              smaller than this number, the factor is changed to (minrefresult
              / original area).  [4mTriangle[24m will use this number as an indicator
              when  refining  the  mesh,  but  will  most  likely not match it
              exactly.

       [1m-maxrefresult max[0m
              Specify maximum area for elements of  refined  grid.  Note  that
              this  is  an estimate only.  In case (original size * factor) is
              larger than this number, the factor is changed to  (maxrefresult
              / original area).  [4mTriangle[24m will use this number as an indicator
              when refining the mesh,  but  will  most  likely  not  match  it
              exactly.

       [1m-x power[0m
              To  get  super  (>1) or sub (<1) linear refinement; used only by
              refinement types 2, 21, 3, 31. For high values of x, the refine-
              ment  is concentrated closely around the target. For low values,
              the refinement tends to spread out more.

       files named domain.1.[poly/node/ele]:

       [1msetarea domain.1 > domain.1.area [22mcreates a a  file  domain.1.area  with
       new  element  areas.  To subsequently update the mesh with the new area
       constraints a next triangulation step is needed (e.g., [1mtriangle  -rpqCa[0m
       [1mdomain.1[22m).     This    results    in    a    new    mesh    in    files
       domain.2.[poly/node/ele].

       Options can be used to control the element area reduction. For example,
       to  gradually  refine  the  top  quarter of the domain we create a file
       domain.1.area with new element areas: [1msetarea domain.1 -l 0 0 1000 0 -a[0m
       [1m25 -f 0.1 -r 1031 > domain.1.area[22m.

       We  subsequently  update  the  mesh in a next triangulation step (e.g.,
       [1mtriangle  -rpqa  domain.1[22m)  resulting  in   a   new   mesh   in   files
       domain.2.[poly/node/ele]:
