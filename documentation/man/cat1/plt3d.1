[1mNAME[0m
       plt3d  -  research  tool aimed at providing ways to 1) output files for
       direct visualization of 3D  [4mGTecton[24m  in-  and  output  data,  2)  moni-
       tor/probe the FEM output for nodes or elements with specific [4mGMSH[24m tags,
       and 3) monitor/probe FEM output for specific node or  element  numbers.
       Most  of the output is written as Visualization Toolkit (VTK) files. In
       the current version, we use the VTK  variant  for  SERIAL  unstructured
       data  (VTU).  The  data  format  is limited to ASCII, i.e., there is no
       BINARY support.  [4mParaView[24m can read and visualize the VTU data.

       NOTE: The functionality of the current version of the code is very lim-
       ited.  The  most important limitation is that the change in output data
       structure (nodal point based to element  based)  that  comes  with  the
       introduction  of  faulted  or  slippery  nodes is hardly recognized and
       implemented. Monitoring is highly incompletely supported.

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mplt3d [22m[options]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mplt3d[24m is an interactive program for examining finite element (FE) input
       and  output  data. [4mplt3d[24m can also be viewed as a filter between FE pro-
       gram [4mf3d[24m and visualization program [4mParaView[24m (for above aim 1).

       When called without a file argument, [4mplt3d[24m reads commands from standard
       input  (stdin). On-line help is provided in this interactive mode in by
       typing "?" or for example "? femi".  When a  file  argument  is  given,
       commands are read from this file until, after the end-of-file (EOF) has
       been reached succesfully, commands are read from stdin.

       2021

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1mnoecho [22mSilent mode, i.e. set echoing off (this is the default).

       [1mecho   [22mEchoing mode. Major stages of the program are reported.

       [1mfile   [22mCommands file name.

[1mFILES[0m
       Files which are special to the program are described  more  extensively
       in  the  [4mf3d[24m(7)  manual  pages.  More  specific,  FE input files are by
       default assumed to be "TECIN.DAT" and "TEMPIN.DAT".  FE  output  is  by
       default assumed to reside in "FEDSK.DAT".
