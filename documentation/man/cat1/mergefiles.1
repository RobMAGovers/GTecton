[1mNAME[0m
       Mergefiles - Merging GTecton output of various processors

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mMergefiles [22m[options]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mMergefiles  [22mis  a  program used to combobulate the output of [4mGtecton[24m of
       all processors into a single file for each time  step.  Note  that  the
       unmerged files are not deleted after a run.

       Mergefiles needs the following input files:

       - [4mpartition.info[24m, generated during the partitioning phase

       - [4mfedsk[24m files from the partitioned run, generated by the simulation

       - [4mmodeldata.dat[24m, generated by the simulation

       - [4mmodeldata.dat.[number][24m files, generated by the simulation


[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       [1mas     [22mThe  input  files are assumed to be ascii, and the merged output
              files will also be written as ascii. This is the default.

       [1mbi     [22mThe input files are assumed to be binary, and the merged  output
              files will also be written as binary.

       [1mclean  [22mThe  input  files will be deleted after they have been read. The
              default is to keep the input files.  After the merging  of  each
              timestep,  the  partitioned data of that timestep is removed, to
              keep the datapeek limited.

       [1mfedsk=[filename][0m
              The base of the filenames of the output. If this option  is  not
              used, the base name is assumed to be the default of [4mFEDSK.DAT[0m

       [1mpartinfo=[filename][0m
              The  partition  info  file created by the partition of the mesh.
              See: `man partition'. If this option is not used,  the  filename
              is assumed to be the default of [4mpartition.info[0m

[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       Let  us  assume  we have completed a GTecton run over 4 processors, and
       that we have output data at timestep 0, 3 and 10

                             Timestep 0       Timestep 3        Timestep 10

              Processor 0 fedsk.par4.00.0   fedsk.par4.03.0    fedsk.par4.10.0
              Processor 1 fedsk.par4.00.1   fedsk.par4.03.1    fedsk.par4.10.1
              Processor 2 fedsk.par4.00.2   fedsk.par4.03.2    fedsk.par4.10.2
              Processor 3 fedsk.par4.00.3   fedsk.par4.03.3    fedsk.par4.10.3

       Running the command [1mmergefiles as fedsk=fedsk.par4 [22mwill give us

                        Timestep 0          Timestep 3           Timestep 10

                      fedsk.par4.00        fedsk.par4.03         fedsk.par4.10

       which can then be processed using plnplt/plt3d
