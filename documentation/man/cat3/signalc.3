       external proc

       When  a  process  incurs a signal (see signal(3)) the default action is
       usually to clean up and abort. The user may choose to write an alterna-
       tive  signal handling routine. A call to signalc is the way this alter-
       nate action is specified to the system.

       signum is the signal number (see signal(3)). If flag is negative,  then
       proc  must  be the name of the user signal handling routine. If flag is
       zero or positive, then proc is ignored and the value of flag is  passed
       to  the  system as the signal action definition. In particular, this is
       how previously saved signal actions can be restored. Two possible  val-
       ues  for  flag have specific meanings: 0 means "use the default action"
       (See NOTES below), 1 means "ignore this signal".
