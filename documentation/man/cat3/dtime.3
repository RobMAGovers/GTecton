       This  routine  returns  elapsed  runtime  in  seconds  for  the calling
       process.  Dtime returns the elapsed time since the last call to  dtime,
       or the start of execution on the first call.

       The  argument  array  returns user time in the first element and system
       time in the second element.  The function value is the sum of user  and
       system time.

       The  resolution  of  all  timing is 1/CLK_TCK seconds, where CLK_TCK is
       processor dependent.  The value of CLK_TCK can  be  queried  using  the
       sysconf(2) call.
