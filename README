Thank you for choosing GTECTON. 
The code is source-controlled with GIT. 
Major version number is 2023.7

The code was initially developed under the name TECTON by Jay Melosh and Arthur Raefsky. 
GTECTON was developed from TECTON version 1.4 (release 1989). 
More on the early history of GTECTON can be found in file HISTORY.

GTECTON is a research code that has been under continual development. 
The research publications below document some of the more outstanding developments. 
I hope that the code is of some use to you for your research. 
Should scientific publications result from your work with GTECTON, 
I ask that you cite relevant papers from the list below so that I get some credit for the work.

The source code consists of the finite element codes themselves (src/04_simulating subdirectory), 
source codes for post-processing (src/06_postprocessing), 
i.e., turning the FE output into files for plotting with GMT, 
and other stuff like mesh generation.

To compile and install the codes, 
start with the INSTALL file in the gtecton subdirectory (after unpacking the tarball).

Currently the code is developed and maintained by 
Rob Govers (r.govers@uu.nl) and Lukas van de Wiel (l.y.vandewiel@uu.nl).
