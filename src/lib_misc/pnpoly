  The C Code

Here is the code, for reference. Excluding lines with only braces, there
are only /8 lines/ of code.

    int pnpoly(int npol, float *xp, float *yp, float x, float y)
    {
      int i, j, c = 0;
      for (i = 0, j = npol-1; i < npol; j = i++) {
        if ((((yp[i]<=y) && (y<yp[j])) ||
             ((yp[j]<=y) && (y<yp[i]))) &&
            (x < (xp[j] - xp[i]) * (y - yp[i]) / (yp[j] - yp[i]) + xp[i]))

          c = !c;
      }
      return c;
    }


  The Method

I run a semi-infinite ray horizontally (increasing x, fixed y) out from
the test point, and count how many edges it crosses. At each crossing,
the ray switches between inside and outside. This is called the /Jordan
curve theorem/.

The case of the ray going thru a vertex is handled correctly via a
careful selection of inequalities. Don't mess with this code unless
you're familiar with the idea of /Simulation of Simplicity/. This
pretends to shift the ray infinitesimally to one side so that it either
clearly intersects, or clearly doesn't touch. Since this is merely a
conceptual, infinitesimal, shift, it never creates an intersection that
didn't exist before, and never destroys an intersection that clearly
existed before.

The ray is tested against each edge thus:

   1. Is the point in the half-plane below the extended edge? and
   2. Is the point's X coordinate within the edge's X-range? 

Handling endpoints here is tricky.


  Originality

I make no claim to having invented the idea. However in 1970, I did
produce the Fortran code given below on my own, and include it in a
package of cartographic SW publicly-distributed by David Douglas, Dept
of Geography, Simon Fraser U and U of Ottawa.

The C code in the FAQ is my code, lightly edited.

Earlier implementations of point-in-polygon testing presumably exist,
tho the code might never have been released. Pointers to prior art,
especially publicly available code, are welcome. One early publication,
which doesn't handle the point on an edge, and has a typo, is this:

    * M Shimrat, "Algorithm 112, Position of Point Relative to Polygon",
      /Comm. ACM/ 5(8), Aug 1962, p 434. 

A well-written recent summary is this:

    * E Haines, /Point in Polygon Strategies/,
      http://www.acm.org/pubs/tog/editors/erich/ptinpoly/, 1994. 


  The Inequality Tests are Tricky

If translating the program to another language, be sure to get the
inequalities in the conditional correct. They were carefully chosen to
make the program work correctly when the point is vertically below a vertex.

Several people have thought that my program was wrong, when really
/they/ had gotten the inequalities wrong.


  C Semantics

My code uses the fact that, in the C language, when executing the code
|a&&b|, if |a| is false, then |b| must not be evaluated. If your
compiler doesn't do this, then it's not implementing C, and you will get
a divide-by-zero, i.a., when the test point is vertically in line with a
vertical edge. When translating this code to another language with
different semantics, then you must implement this test explicitly.


  Point on a (Boundary) Edge

PNPOLY partitions the plane into points inside the polygon and points
outside the polygon. Points that are on the boundary are classified as
either inside or outside.

   1. Any particular point is always classified consistently the same
      way. In the following figure, consider what PNPOLY would say when
      the red point, /P/, is tested against the two triangles, /T_L /
      and /T_R /. Depending on internal roundoff errors, PNPOLY may say
      that /P/ is in /T_L / or in /T_R /. However it will always give
      the same answer when /P/ is tested against those triangles. That
      is, if PNPOLY finds that /P/ is in /T_L /, then it will find that
      /P/ is not /T_R /. If PNPOLY finds that /P/ is not in /T_L /, then
      it will find that /P/ is in /T_R /.

   2. If you want to know when a point is exactly on the boundary, you
      need another program. This is only one of many functions that
      PNPOLY lacks; it also doesn't predict tomorrow's weather. You are
      free to extend PNPOLY's source code.
   3. The first reason for this is the numerical analysis position that
      you should not be testing exact equality unless your input is
      exact. Even then, computational roundoff error would often make
      the result wrong.
   4. The second reason is that, if you partition a region of the plane
      into polygons, i.e., form a planar graph, then PNPOLY will locate
      each point into exactly one polygon. In other words, PNPOLY
      considers each polygon to be topologically a semi-open set. This
      makes things simpler, i.e., causes fewer special cases, if you use
      PNPOLY as part of a larger system. Examples of this include
      locating a point in a planar graph, and intersecting two planar
      graphs. 


  Multiple Components and Holes

   1.

      The polygon may contain multiple separate components, and/or
      holes, provided that you separate the components and holes with a
      (0,0) vertex, as follows.

         1.

            First, include a (0,0) vertex.

         2.

            Then include the first component' vertices, repeating its
            first vertex after the last vertex.

         3.

            Include another (0,0) vertex.

         4.

            Include another component or hole, repeating its first
            vertex after the last vertex.

         5.

            Repeat the above two steps for each component and hole.

         6.

            Include a final (0,0) vertex.

   2.

      For example, let three components' vertices be A1, A2, A3, B1, B2,
      B3, and C1, C2, C3. Let two holes be H1, H2, H3, and I1, I2, I3.
      Let O be the point (0,0). List the vertices thus:

      O, A1, A2, A3, A1, O, B1, B2, B3, B1, O, C1, C2, C3, C1, O, H1,
      H2, H3, H1, O, I1, I2, I3, I1, O.

   3.

      Each component or hole's vertices may be listed either clockwise
      or counter-clockwise.

   4.

      If there is only one connected component, then it is optional to
      repeat the first vertex at the end. It's also optional to surround
      the component with zero vertices.


  Testing Which One of Many Polygons Contains the Point

This is called the *point location* problem in computational geometry,
see [Preparata]. There are many methods with different requirements for
preprocessing time and storage, versus query time. If the polygons form
a planar graph with each edge labelled with its two polygon neighbors,
then one simple way is to run a semi-infinite ray up from the point
until it hits its first edge. Then the relevant containing polygon is
one of that edge's neighbors.


  Explanation of /"for (i = 0, j = npol-1; i < npol; j = i++)"/

The intention is to execute the loop for each i from 0 to npol-1. For
each iteration, j is i-1. However that wraps, so if i=0 then j=npol-1.
Therefore the current edge runs between verts j and i, and the loop is
done once per edge. In detail:

   1. Start by setting i and j:
      i = 0
      j = npol-1
   2. If i<npol is false then exit the loop.
   3. Do the loop body.
   4. Set j=i and then
      add 1 to i and then
   5. Go back to step 2.

  Converting the Code to All Integers

If you want to convert the code from floats to integers, consider these
points.

   1. On many current processors floats are at least as fast as ints.
   2. If you move the denominator over to the other side of the
      inequality, remember that, when the denominator is negative, the
      inequality will flip.
   3. If coordinates are large enough, the multiplication will silently
      overflow.

  Inclusion Testing by Subtended Angles

This is another method of testing whether a point is inside a polygon.

   1. Join the test point to each edge in turn
   2. Calculate the angle that the point subtends at the edge.
   3. Note that the edge must be directed (that is, you know the
      starting point from the ending point), and this angle must be signed.
   4. Add the angles.
   5. The result must be either 0 or 2pi.
   6. The test point is inside iff the result is 2pi. 

This method is obvious but not good.

   1. The simple implementation requires an /arctan/ evaluation for each
      edge, which is slow.
   2. The arctan can be avoided with a careful use of the arctan sum
      formula, but this is also tricky.
   3. Properly handling the case where the edge crosses the positive
      X-axis is tricky.
   4. Finally, if you handle the above problems correctly and optimize
      the algorithm, then this method reduces to the Jordan curve formula. 


  Convex Polygons, such as Rectangles

If the polygon is convex, then an alternate method is this.

   1.

      Find the equation of the infinite line that contains each edge.

   2.

      Express each equation as an expression: /d=ax+by+c/. Points on the
      line will give zero.

   3.

      Standardize each equation so that if a point inside the polygon is
      substituted in, the result is positive, or equivalently an outside
      point will be negative.

   4.

      Now, test your test point against every line. It's inside the
      polygon iff it's on the inside side of every line.

   5.

      Note that the equation is particularly simple for horizontal and
      vertical edges.


  Almost Convex Polygons

   1.

      What if you like testing your point against the line equations,
      but, unfortunately, your polygon is not convex?

   2.

      It is possible to express the interior of any polygon as a boolean
      expression in the half-planes defined by the edges. For the convex
      polygon below,

      let /A/ be a Boolean expression that is true if the test point is
      on the inside side of the infinite line containing this edge of
      the polygon. Ditto /B, C, D/.

   3.

      Then, the Boolean expression for the polygon's interior is
      /A.B.C.D/, that is, the four line expressions /and/ed together.

   4.

      Now consider the following concave polygon,

      As before, /A, B, C, D, E, F/ are Boolean expressions for the test
      point being on the inside side of each edge in turn.

   5.

      Then, the Boolean expression for the polygon's interior is this

      /A.B.C.(D+E+F)/

   6.

      A similar formula exists for any 2D polygon.

   7.

      However, not all 3D polyhedra have such formulae. This is yet
      another difference between 2D and 3D. For more differences, see
      here <2d_3d_diff.html>.


  3D Polygons

   1.

      By this, I mean a flat polygon embedded in a plane in 3D.

   2.

      Simply project the polygon's vertices, and the test point, into 2D.

   3.

      Do the projection by deleting one coordinate, e.g., project
      /(x,y,z)/ to /(x,z)/.

   4.

      For numerical stability, delete the coordinate with the smallest
      range.


  Testing Point Inclusion in a Polyhedron

Here is one way to test whether a 3D point in inside a polyhedron.

   1. Run a semi-infinite ray up from the point, P, and
   2. Count how many faces it crosses.

The ray crosses face F iff

   1. P lies below the plane of F, and
   2. when P is projected (in the direction of the ray) onto the plane
      of F, then it is inside F. This is a
      2D point-containment problem <pnpoly.html>. 

If the ray intersects a vertex or an edge, then you're in trouble.
Consider perturbing P slightly. Simulation of Simplicity provides a
better, more complicated, solution.


  If You Have a Suggestion or Find an Error

I'm always interested in error reports, altho it might take awhile to
respond. So far, there have been some good suggestions. However, all but
one of the error reports have themselves been erroneous. I've
incorporated their errors in this file. It's truly amazing how much
trouble an 8-line program can cause!

multiple component polygons. Thanks to Mark Sullivan for suggesting the
documentation change from "vertical" to "horizontal".
