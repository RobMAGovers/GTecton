2017.3      March 2017             ALL     Slippery nodes working on multiptocessor runs.
                                           Most of the implicit variables removed.
                                           Part of the static memory allocation removed.

2017.9      September 2017         ALL     Polysort has maximum polygon size increased from 10k to 10M
                                           bugfix: plnplt 'slip' now gives good coordinates
                                           bugfix: plnplt 'nbc' command now returns values.
                                           bugfix: FEDSK files now contain correct velocities in ascii,
                                           More implicitness removed, implicitly fixing bugs.
                                           bugfix: Plt3d now correctly computes centers of elements.
                                           bugfix: Plnplt now correctly writes strain rate files (rate command)
                                           bugfix: ...and elemenental boundary condition file (ebc command)
                                           plnplt now accepts blank lines in scripts
                                           plnplt and plt3d help now take '? set' beside '? se'
                                           elmside now gives an error if node or elem file is empty
                                           Now use system soelim. Minimum version 1.21, 
                                                 in stead of own implementation
                                           bugfix: Elmside now scans element array with element index,
                                                 and nodal point arrays with nodal point index, instead
                                                 of both with the element index.
                                           The main storage is now dynamically allocated. This limits
                                                 the data size to the machine memory size, in stead of to
                                                 the 2GB maximum. These allocations can be set in module 
                                                 TempSrc/AAAB.F
                                           bugfix: The content of environment variable MYTMP is now used as 
                                                 temporary directory. Somehow this feature broke down in the
                                                 past.
                                           More implicit variables removed.
                                           Plt3d has the 'edi' command fixed for total, x, y and z 
                                                 displacements. Slippery and split displacements remain
                                                 to be done. The VTU output still works well.
                                           Plnplt now changed. After an 'edi slip' command, a regular edi 
                                                 command gives regular edi, in stead of slippery displacement 
                                           Contributions to the load vector from time dependent traction fixed.
                                           bugfix: Plt3d has error value of elctr now proper initialised

2017.10     September 2017         FEM     IWINX for non-period load fixed
                     					   ISHELL/JSHELL bug in plnplt
                                           Gmsh2tecton now works a lot faster, thanks to Matt Herman,
                                                because a double loop over the elements has been replaced
                                                by a lookup table and a single loop.
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: Plt3d; echo=2 no longer prints 
                                                entire model input
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: di slippery now prints slippery disp 
                                                instead of total displacement
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: di slippery no longer prints zeros for
                                                monitored nodes
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: sampling in 3D no longer segfaults because
                                                numFN was used where it had to be numFNglobal
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: sampling over nodes now gives physically 
                                                correct values, as variable 'qnty' is passed correctly
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: sampling in 3D now takes the correct number
                                                of strain matrix entries.
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: Attempting to sample outside the domain now
                                                gives a warning in stead of an exit.
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: 3D contour prints all dispalcements 
                                                components, in stead of only the first one.
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: printing slippery nodes in FEOUT does no 
                                                longer crash when the global element ID > local n 
                                                elements local
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: a 3D vertex can now have a maximum of a 100
                                                elements that contain that vertex, in stead of 50, which
                                                turned out to be not enough. A check has been build in to
                                                see whether some peculiar might have more than a 100 element 
                                                on a vertex, and gives an error message/hint to increase the 
                                                num.
                                                (similar for 2D, with a maximum of 20 increased to 30)
                                           Bugfix, by Matt Herman: strain of sampled element in 3D now also 
                                                print the z component, in stead of only x and y
                                           Plt3d now fully explicit!
                                           Buffer files are correctly written in MYTMP, in stead of in PWD
                                           Optimization, by Matt Herman: adjacency tables generated much 
                                                faster, when using slippery nodes.
                                           Monitoring nodes in 3D fixed. Interpretation of monitoring 
                                                intervals were interpreted incorrectly.
                                           Thermal benchmarks included and validated, both on single and 
                                                multiprocessor runs, validating:
                                                - initial temperature fields
                                                - heat flux boundary conditions
                                                - heat production boundary conditions
                                           Plnplt is now able to sample heat flux, using
                                                - sample q ...  (see also '? sample' within plnplt)

2018.02     February 2018           PLT    Bugfix, by Rob Govers: Volumetric strain rate now has the correct
                                                value, in stead of the same as the strain.
                                    PLT    Bugfix: plnplt and plt3d in line help now correctly diplays the 
                                                help of the command that have a one letter command starting 
                                                with their character. For example, '? wait', '? write', '? we' 
                                                and '? wq' were all equivalent to '? w', before this fix.
                                    PLT    Bugfix: in-line help of axiplt regarding stress and strain and 
                                                strain rate now display components according in r, z, t frame, 
                                                in stead of the pln frame of z, y and z.
                                    ALL    All references to PETSc are cleaned up, making is easier to 
                                                upgrade PETSc versions in the future.
                                    ALL    Upgraded PETSc to 3.8.1. This allowes for better interaction with 
                                                Fortran, and makes it easier to work with MUMPS.
                                    ALL    Following this update, GTecton now runs on MPI 1.8.5; the version
                                                supplied with PETSc 3.8.1.
                                    ALL    With this update, several changes have been to the INSTALL file,
                                                most importantly in the required package list, and the
                                                default PETSc configure script.
                                    ALL    Modifying petscsysdef.h during install procedure is no longer
                                                necessary, by adding a compile flag.
                                    ALL    Expanded error handling of the PETSc interface
                                    PLT    plnplt now has the new command 'mesh', used to print properties
                                                of the mesh as contour data for GMT. It has two arguments. 
                                                The type of quality, and the filename to which to write it. 
                                                Possible properties are:
                                                - area       size of the elements

                                    PLT    Several plnplt commands are now also tested nightly,
                                           The mesh quality command mentioned above among them.
                                           This will be expanded upon in the future.
                                    PLT    Sampling a point in Plt3d now starts searching at the element 
                                           in which the previously sampled point was found, in stead of 
                                           in element 1. This speeds up the sampling process. Sampling the
                                           very first point still starts at element 1.

                                    PLT    Bugfix in Makefile. Plnplt and plt3d now properly depend on

                                           as previsouly there was only a single digit space.
                                           Up to 10k patitions are supported, now.
                                    ALL    partition2paraview had been added to the tools, which creates

                                           are not confused with FEM files from other runs. The hours and
                                           minutes and seconds were separated with a colon. Windows cannot
                                           handle colons in filenames, and when running GTecton in a Linux
                                           virtual machine on a Windows host, this caused GTecton to crash.
                                           To fix this, the colons have been replaced by dashes, to match 
                                           the date separators.
                                    PLT    When a plot program does not recognize a command, it now tells
                                           which command that was.
                                    PLN    Solution vector is checked for inifinity and NaNs to detect
                                           failures in an early stage of the simulation
                                    PLN    Load vector and stiffness matrix are also tested for infinity 
                                           and NaN entries, to prevent ugly crashes when they occur.
                                    PLT    Added possibility to write displacement of monitored nodes in 3D
                                    PLN    A check added whether the slippery nodes with only positive

                                           NaNs and inftys in the solution vector
                                    PLN    TECIN.DAT now has an optional entry for the maximum number of 
                                           neighbors, in order to limit the space allocated to
                                           administrate those nodes. This entry comes after 
                                           the number of materials, and is a 12 digit integer.
                                           When not used, default for 3D is 50, and for 2D 30.
                                           This maximum can be obtained with "minmax tecin.dat.partf.nps"

                                           and the maximum of the 6th entry in 3D, or the 5th in 2D.
                                    PLN    some global arrays that are used when creating the parallel
                                           numbering were not deallocated after use. They now are.

                                           equationsmaskxt and verticesmask, so that their space is available
                                           when PETSc start the linear solve.
                                    ALL    Compiled and tested with GCC 6.3.0.
                                    ALL    Friction functionality has been added to slippery nodes.
                                           In the code this is captured in #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_FRICTION

                                           out better.
                                    PLN    During previous release, writing of FEOUT broke down.
                                           This has been fixed.
                                    PLN    *** Static friction has been added. See the manuals for more

                                    PLN    Because of this, differential strength is also written to the FEDSK files.
                                  TOOLS    Elmside has a new algorithm to determine on which side of a fault
                                           an element is located. This works better for curved faults.
                                    PLN    A check is implemented to see whether each slippery node has
                                           adjacent elements of both positive and negative signs.
                                           If this is not the case but a solve is made anyway, 
                                           solution vector has NaNs and/or infinities, which is very hard
                                           to trace.
                                  MERGE    A logarithm of zero caused mergefiles to not quite crash, 
                                           but throw an IEEE_INVALID_FLAG IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO, which is now 
                                           fixed.

                                           added in the future.
                                    PLT    sampling displacement and velocities very close to nodal
                                           points gave strange and incorrect numbers. This has been fixed.
									PLT    VTU write now also takes differential displacements and
                                           differential velocities into account when plotting these.
									PLT    'show dt' gave a segfault when there were only thermal 
                                           or only mechanical timesteps. This has been fixed.
                                           Output format is changed to write only the timesteps given.
                                    PLT    Plt3d can plot a subsection of the domain that consists 
										   of triangles. Particularly useful for the surface of a 
                                           domain. This can be done with the syntax: set tag [number].
                                           In this fashion, only displacement, velocities and 
										   tractions can be written. More quantities may be added in 
                						   the future.
                                    PLT    Plt3d now plots correct differential velocities on 
                                           deformed meshes.
                                    PLT    The typo 'strain rate' has been corrected to 'strainrate'

                                    PLT    Matt added 'xsec' command to take planar cross-sections through 3-D
